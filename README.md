# Logo Generator
This is a Node.js command-line application that generates simple logos based on user input. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## User Story
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria
-The command-line application accepts user input

-The user can enter up to three characters for the logo text

-The user can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number) for both the text and the shape

-The user can choose a shape for the logo from a list of options: circle, triangle, and square

-When the user has entered input for all the prompts, the application generates an SVG file named logo.svg and prints -Generated logo.svg" in the command line

-When the logo.svg file is opened in a browser, the user is shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria they entered

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/logo-generator.git

Navigate to the root directory of the project using cd logo-generator

Install the required dependencies using npm install

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

node index.js

The application will prompt you to enter the text for the logo, the text color, the shape, and the shape color. Once you have entered input for all the prompts, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the root directory of the project. The output text "Generated logo.svg" will be printed in the command line.

To view the generated logo, open the logo.svg file in a web browser.
